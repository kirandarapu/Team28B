data-driven testing:

add screenshot to the report:
when the testcase should fail attach related testcase to the report


CODE implementation:

1.tescase creation
2.pom adopt
3.log file 
4.capture scrrenshots
5.report generation
6.properties file reading
7.data driven testing

2.Code Execution: execute our testcases into different ways

4 ways:
1.by using pom.xml file

 step 1: download apache maven into your local system and set environment variables
 step2: add 2 plugins into pom.xml file (maven-compiler plugin ,surefire plugin)
 step3: run your testcases by using pom.xml file

2.by using CMD

 step1: go to your project location and open the cmd on that location
 step 2: enter some command (mvn clean install) click on Enter 

3.by using run.bat file

step 1: go to project location
step 2: create run.bat file
step 3: add some commands into batch file(cd path of project, mvn install)

4.by using jenkins:

what is Jenkins:it is open-source CI/CD tool,
the main purpose of this tool ,continuous integration and continous deployement /deliveribles

agile methodologies


ex: 2 features test==>sprint1
    2 features test ==> sprint 2

time schedulings ==> every friday ==>3:00 pm ==> failure message

1day ==>automate  ==> developer (code changes) ==>day ==>3:00pm 

jenkins: seamless execution tool(don't show any UI part,finally execution shoul be completed,then get the output of your program
